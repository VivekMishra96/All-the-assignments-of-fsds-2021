        "(a) To find the probability that no one has the same seat for both courses, we can consider the number of possible permutations without any overlap and divide it by the total number of possible permutations. Let's calculate it step by step:\n",

        "1. The first student has 100 possible seats in the lecture hall.\n",
        "2. For the second student, there are 99 remaining seats to choose from (since they cannot occupy the same seat as the first student).\n",
