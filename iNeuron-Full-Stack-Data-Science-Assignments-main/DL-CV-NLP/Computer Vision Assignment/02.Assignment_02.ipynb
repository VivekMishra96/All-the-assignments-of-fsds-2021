    "**Ans:** The representation of an image can take many forms. Most of the time, it refers to the way that the conveyed information, such as color, is coded digitally and how the image is stored, i.e., how is structured an image file. Several open or patented standards were proposed to create, manipulate, store and exchange digital images. They describe the format of image files, the algorithms of image encoding such as compression as well as the format of additional information often called metadata.\n",

    "Tensors can be understood as nested lists of objects of the previous order all with the same size. For example, an order three tensor can be thought of as a list of matrices all of which have the same number of rows and columns. These matrices are tensors of order two and since they have all the same number of rows and columns, the tensor of order three is actually like a cuboid of numbers and we can find numbers by going along any of the three-axis. Each number is identified by the row, the column, and the depth at which itâ€™s stored. We can formalize this idea in the concept of shape."
