The bottom layer generates 100 function maps, the middle layer 200, and the top layer 400. RGB images with a size of 200 x 300 pixels are used as input. How many criteria does the CNN have in total? How much RAM would this network need when making a single instance prediction if we're using 32-bit floats? What if you were to practice on a batch of 50 images ?"
