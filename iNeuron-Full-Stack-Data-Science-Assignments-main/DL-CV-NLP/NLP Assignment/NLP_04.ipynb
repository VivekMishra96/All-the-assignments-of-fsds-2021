In many applications, such as natural language processing or speech recognition, sequences may have different lengths. dynamic_rnn() allows you to pass sequences with varying lengths as input by dynamically unrolling the RNN computation graph, adjusting the computation steps based on the actual sequence lengths. This flexibility is crucial in dealing with real-world data where sequences can be of different lengths.\n",

        "**Efficient Memory Usage: dynamic_rnn()** optimizes memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for the sequence inputs during runtime. It avoids the need to unroll the entire sequence beforehand, which can be memory-intensive, especially for long sequences. Instead, it allocates memory for each time step as needed, resulting in more efficient memory utilization.\n",

        "**Computational Efficiency: dynamic_rnn()** can be more computationally efficient compared to static_rnn() for sequences with varying lengths. It eliminates the overhead of creating and managing a fixed-length graph structure, as dynamic_rnn() constructs the graph dynamically based on the input sequences at runtime. This can lead to faster training and inference times.\n",
