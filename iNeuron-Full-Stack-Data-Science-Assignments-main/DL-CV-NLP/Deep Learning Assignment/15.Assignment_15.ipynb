    "- a.\tIn this exercise you will build a DNN that compares two MNIST digit images and predicts whether they represent the same digit or not. Then you will reuse the lower layers of this network to train an MNIST classifier using very little training data. Start by building two DNNs (let’s call them DNN A and B), both similar to the one you built earlier but without the output layer: each DNN should have five hidden layers of 100 neurons each, He initialization, and ELU activation. Next, add one more hidden layer with 10 units on top of both DNNs. To do this, you should use TensorFlow’s concat() function with axis=1 to concatenate the outputs of both DNNs for each instance, then feed the result to the hidden layer. Finally, add an output layer with a single neuron using the logistic activation function.\n",
    "- b.\tSplit the MNIST training set in two sets: split #1 should containing 55,000 images, and split #2 should contain contain 5,000 images. Create a function that generates a training batch where each instance is a pair of MNIST images picked from split #1. Half of the training instances should be pairs of images that belong to the same class, while the other half should be images from different classes. For each pair, the training label should be 0 if the images are from the same class, or 1 if they are from different classes.\n",
    "- c.\tTrain the DNN on this training set. For each image pair, you can simultaneously feed the first image to DNN A and the second image to DNN B. The whole network will gradually learn to tell whether two images belong to the same class or not.\n",
    "- d.\tNow create a new DNN by reusing and freezing the hidden layers of DNN A and adding a softmax output layer on top with 10 neurons. Train this network on split #2 and see if you can achieve high performance despite having only 500 images per class."
