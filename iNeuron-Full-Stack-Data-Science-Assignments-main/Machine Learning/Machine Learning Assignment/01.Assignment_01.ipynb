    "##### 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\" ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Machine learning Popularly known as ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values."

    "##### 2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The following are some of the issues where Machine Learning can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Image Recognition`**: Image recognition is one of the most common applications of machine learning. It is used to identify objects, persons, places, digital images, etc. The popular use case of image recognition and face detection is **Automatic friend tagging suggestion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Speech Recognition`**: While using Google, we get an option of **Search by voice**, it comes under speech recognition, and it's a popular application of Machine Learning. Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions  into text, and it is also known as **Speech to text**, or **Computer based speech recognition** At present, machine learning algorithms are widely used by various applications of speech recognition. Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are using speech recognition technology to follow the voice instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Traffic prediction`**: It predicts the traffic conditions such as whether traffic is cleared, slow-moving, or heavily congested with the help of two ways: Real Time location of the vehicle form Google Map app and sensors Average time has taken on past days at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Product recommendations`**: Machine learning is widely used by various e-commerce and entertainment companies such as Amazon, Netflix, etc., for product recommendation to the user."

    "**Ans:** Model parameter determines how a model will predict given a new instance. Model usually has more than one parameter (i.e. slope of a linear model). Hyperparameter is a parameter for the learning algorithm, not of a model."

    "**Ans:** Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function."
